# dual-pivot-quicksort-2.0
Fastest quicksort in the west, check the principles and implement it faster than I ever could

### California Polytechnic University of Humboldt (https://www.humboldt.edu/) locked me out of my abl7@humboldt.edu email so I lost the paper but the proof is in the code. And if you can't read the code, just go ask any Amazon engineer if it's legit. Or Meta eningeer. Here you go guys, 20-50% faster SQL databases if you can understand my logic. Thank you Scott Burgess at Humboldt State University back in 2018 for being my research advisor. I couldn't have done it without the support of all my professors in the past. Thank you everyone who supported me throughout the years. Race me to P=NP, I think it's possible. THANK YOU EVERYONE! Elon Musk is the first to know :)
